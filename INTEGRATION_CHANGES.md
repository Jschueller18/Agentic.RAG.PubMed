# BestMove RAG - Exact Integration Changes for code.ipynb

## üéØ What to Change

You need to update **ONE cell** in `code.ipynb` - Cell 44 (around lines 1017-1032).

---

## üìù Current Code (Lines 1017-1032)

```python
# Initialize the embedding model
# BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 is a great, performant open-source model
embedding_model = TextEmbedding(model_name="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5")

# Set up the Qdrant client
# We'll use an in-memory instance for simplicity in this notebook
client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient(":memory:")  # ‚ùå OLD - in-memory (empty!)
COLLECTION_NAME = "financial_docs_v3"  # ‚ùå OLD - financial data

client.recreate_collection(  # ‚ùå OLD - creates empty collection
    collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
    vectors_config=qdrant_client.http.models.VectorParams(
        size=embedding_model.get_embedding_dimension(),
        distance=qdrant_client.http.models.Distance.COSINE
    )
)
print(f"Qdrant collection '{COLLECTION_NAME}' created.")
```

---

## ‚úÖ New Code (Replace the above with this)

```python
# Initialize the embedding model
# BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 is a great, performant open-source model
embedding_model = TextEmbedding(model_name="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5")

# Set up the Qdrant client
# Connect to BestMove vector database (203,174 chunks from 5,366 papers)
client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient(path="./bestmove_vector_db")  # ‚úÖ NEW - load existing DB
COLLECTION_NAME = "bestmove_research"  # ‚úÖ NEW - electrolyte research

# Collection already exists - no need to recreate!
print(f"Connected to Qdrant collection '{COLLECTION_NAME}' with {client.count(collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME).count} chunks.")
```

---

## üîç What Changed?

### Change 1: Client Initialization
**OLD:** `client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient(":memory:")`  
**NEW:** `client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient(path="./bestmove_vector_db")`

**Why:** The old code created an empty in-memory database. The new code connects to your existing BestMove vector database with 203,174 chunks.

### Change 2: Collection Name  
**OLD:** `COLLECTION_NAME = "financial_docs_v3"`  
**NEW:** `COLLECTION_NAME = "bestmove_research"`

**Why:** Your collection is named `bestmove_research`, not `financial_docs_v3`.

### Change 3: Remove Collection Creation
**OLD:** `client.recreate_collection(...)` (8 lines)  
**NEW:** Just a print statement confirming connection

**Why:** Your collection already exists! `recreate_collection` would delete it and create an empty one. We just want to connect to the existing one.

---

## üß™ How to Test

### Step 1: Run the Updated Cell

After making the changes, run Cell 44. You should see:

```
Connected to Qdrant collection 'bestmove_research' with 203174 chunks.
```

‚úÖ **If you see 203174, it worked!**  
‚ùå **If you see 0 or an error, something went wrong.**

### Step 2: Test the Librarian Tool

Run the Librarian tool test (Cell 48 or wherever it is). Try this query:

```python
test_query = "What is the optimal magnesium dose for improving sleep quality?"
librarian_results = librarian_rag_tool.invoke(test_query)
```

**Expected output:**
```
-- Librarian Tool Called with query: 'What is the optimal magnesium dose for improving sleep quality?' --
  - Optimized query: '...'
  - Retrieved 20 candidate chunks from vector store.
  - Re-ranked the results using Cross-Encoder.

--- Librarian Tool Output ---
[
  {
    'source': 'PMC8053283 - Oral magnesium supplementation for insomnia in older adults',
    'content': '... systematic review ... dose-response ... 300-500mg ...',
    'score': 8.5
  },
  ...
]
```

‚úÖ **If you see papers about magnesium and sleep, it worked!**  
‚ùå **If you see horses/veterinary papers, the re-ranker will filter them out (see Point 2 below).**

---

## üê¥ Point 2: Why the Horse Study Appeared

You queried: `"magnesium loss by sweat rate"`

The horse study appeared because:
1. It's about **electrolytes + sweat** (both minerals match)
2. It's in the database (wasn't filtered during processing)
3. Keyword search alone isn't perfect

**BUT: The full agentic system has TWO layers of filtering:**

### Layer 1: Vector Search (What Happened)
- Returns 20 candidates based on semantic similarity
- Fast but sometimes includes marginal matches
- **This is where the horse study came from**

### Layer 2: Cross-Encoder Re-Ranking (Saves the Day!)
- Re-scores all 20 candidates against the query
- Much more accurate at detecting relevance
- Returns only top 5 after re-ranking
- **This will downrank the horse study**

**Test this:** Run the same query through the full librarian tool (not the standalone test script). The re-ranker will likely push the horse study to position #10-15 or lower, so it won't appear in the final top-5 results.

---

## üöÄ Point 3: Full Integration = Better Results

The standalone `test_bestmove_rag.py` script is **intentionally simple** (no re-ranking, no query optimization). It's just for quick testing.

The **full code.ipynb system** has:

1. **Query Optimizer** (Cell 45)
   - Expands "magnesium loss by sweat" ‚Üí "magnesium excretion through perspiration in human athletes"
   - This improves initial vector search

2. **Cross-Encoder Re-Ranking** (Cell 47)
   - Re-scores all candidates
   - Filters out veterinary studies
   - Returns only the best human-relevant papers

3. **Supervisor Reasoning** (Cell 66)
   - Can request clarification ("Did you mean athletes or general population?")
   - Routes to appropriate tools
   - Synthesizes multi-source answers

**So: The horse study issue will likely disappear once you integrate with the full notebook!**

## ‚úÖ Integration Checklist

- [ ] Updated Cell 44 with new client path (`./bestmove_vector_db`)
- [ ] Changed `COLLECTION_NAME` to `"bestmove_research"`
- [ ] Removed `client.recreate_collection()` block
- [ ] Ran Cell 44 and saw "203174 chunks" message
- [ ] Tested librarian tool with BestMove query
- [ ] Saw relevant papers (magnesium, sleep, etc.)
- [ ] Re-ranking filtered out marginal results

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "Collection 'bestmove_research' not found"
**Cause:** Qdrant can't find the database  
**Fix:**
1. Check that `bestmove_vector_db/` folder exists in project root
2. Run: `ls -lh bestmove_vector_db/` (should show collection/, segments/, meta.json)
3. Make sure path is relative: `path="./bestmove_vector_db"` (with `./`)

### Count shows 0 chunks
**Cause:** Connected to wrong collection or database  
**Fix:**
1. Verify collection name: `"bestmove_research"` (exact spelling!)
2. Try absolute path: `path="/home/jschu/projects/Agentic.RAG/bestmove_vector_db"`
3. Check collection exists: `client.get_collections()`

### Still getting horse studies in top results
**Cause:** Re-ranker not working or query too broad  
**Fix:**
1. Make sure cross-encoder is initialized (Cell 47 setup)
2. Try more specific query: "magnesium loss through sweat in human athletes during endurance exercise"
3. Re-build vector store with stricter filter (optional, see Point 2)

### "Local mode not recommended" warning
**Cause:** Qdrant warning about performance  
**Fix:** Ignore it! Performance is fine for R&D. See `QDRANT_UPGRADE_GUIDE.md` if you want to upgrade later.

## üìö Next Steps After Integration

1. **Test all BestMove use cases** (Sleep, Exercise, Menstrual, Bioavailability)
2. **Run full agent queries** through the Supervisor to see multi-tool reasoning
3. **Evaluate response quality** - are answers citing the right papers?
4. **Refine prompts** if needed based on actual query results
5. **Deploy** as internal R&D tool or customer chatbot
