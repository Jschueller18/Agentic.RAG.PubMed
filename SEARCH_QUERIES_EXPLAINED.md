# PMC Search Queries - BestMove Optimized

## What Makes These Queries Better?

### Original (Generic):
❌ "magnesium AND supplementation" → Too broad, includes unrelated studies

### BestMove-Optimized (Specific):
✅ "magnesium AND (bioavailability OR absorption) AND (citrate OR glycinate OR oxide OR threonate)"
   → Only studies comparing the EXACT forms you care about!

## 26 Search Queries Organized by Use Case

### 🔬 Bioavailability & Absorption (Queries 1-3)
**Why:** Need to know which forms are best absorbed

1. **Magnesium forms** - citrate, glycinate, oxide, threonate comparisons
2. **Calcium forms** - citrate, carbonate, lactate comparisons
3. **Potassium forms** - citrate, chloride comparisons

**What you'll get:** Studies showing "glycinate has 42% absorption vs oxide 4%"

---

### 📊 Dose-Response Studies (Queries 4-6)
**Why:** THE GOLD - exact mg amounts → exact outcomes

4. **Magnesium for sleep** - dose-response curves for sleep latency
5. **Magnesium supplementation** - general dose-response relationships
6. **Calcium supplementation** - dose-response data

**What you'll get:** "300mg magnesium → 15 min sleep improvement (p<0.001)"

---

### 😴 Sleep Support Mix (Queries 7-9)
**Why:** Direct support for Sleep Quality use case

7. **Magnesium RCTs for sleep** - randomized controlled trials only
8. **Magnesium-L-threonate** - specific to cognitive/sleep benefits
9. **Magnesium glycinate** - specific to sleep applications

**What you'll get:** Clinical trials showing exact sleep improvements by dose

---

### 🏃 Workout Performance Mix (Queries 10-13)
**Why:** Exercise-specific electrolyte needs

10. **Electrolytes + sweat loss** - actual perspiration data
11. **Sodium + athletic performance** - performance outcomes
12. **Electrolyte replacement** - post-exercise recovery
13. **Potassium + exercise** - exercise-specific needs

**What you'll get:** Sweat loss coefficients, sodium loss rates, replacement protocols

---

### 🩸 Menstrual Support Mix (Queries 14-16)
**Why:** Hormone-specific mineral needs

14. **Magnesium for menstrual symptoms** - PMS, dysmenorrhea studies
15. **Calcium + magnesium** - synergistic effects for menstrual issues
16. **Magnesium for cramps** - specific to menstrual cramping

**What you'll get:** Optimal doses for PMS symptoms, Ca:Mg ratios

---

### 👥 Population Differences (Queries 17-19)
**Why:** Individual variability factors (age, sex, body composition)

17. **Age effects** - elderly vs young absorption differences
18. **Sex differences** - gender-specific metabolism
19. **Body composition** - BMI, lean mass effects on dosing

**What you'll get:** "Women need 1.15x dose" or "elderly absorb 30% less"

---

### ⚖️ Forms Comparison (Queries 20-22)
**Why:** Choosing the BEST form for each use case

20. **Magnesium forms head-to-head** - direct comparisons
21. **Calcium forms comparison** - citrate vs carbonate
22. **Magnesium forms + bioavailability** - absorption rankings

**What you'll get:** "For sleep: glycinate > citrate > oxide"

---

### ⏰ Timing & Interactions (Queries 23-25)
**Why:** When to take, what not to combine

23. **Timing studies** - circadian, chronotherapy
24. **Mineral interactions** - Ca/Mg/Zn interference
25. **Safety & side effects** - tolerance, adverse effects

**What you'll get:** "Take magnesium 2h before bed" or "Calcium blocks zinc absorption"

---

## Expected Results Per Query

**Conservative estimate:**
- Query 1 (magnesium bioavailability): ~500-1,000 papers
- Query 7 (magnesium sleep RCTs): ~200-500 papers
- Query 10 (electrolytes + sweat): ~300-600 papers

**Total expected: 5,000-10,000 unique papers after deduplication**

---

## Quality Filters Built-In

✅ **"open access"[filter]** - only legal, downloadable papers
✅ **Specific terms** - citrate, glycinate, etc. (not generic)
✅ **Study types** - RCT, clinical trial (high quality)
✅ **Outcomes** - sleep, performance, symptoms (measurable)
✅ **Forms** - exact supplement forms you care about

---

## What You WON'T Get (By Design)

❌ Animal studies (unless explicitly relevant)
❌ In vitro studies (cell cultures)
❌ Unrelated minerals (iron, copper, etc.)
❌ Disease-specific studies (unless relevant to general population)
❌ Paywalled papers (legal risk)

## Relevance to BestMove Algorithms

### Daily Wellness Mix:
- Queries 1-3: Bioavailability → form selection
- Queries 17-19: Population differences → scaling factors

### Workout Performance Mix:
- Queries 10-13: Sweat loss → sodium calculations
- Query 24: Interactions → timing recommendations

### Sleep Quality Mix:
- Queries 4, 7-9: Dose-response → optimal mg amounts
- Query 23: Timing → when to take

### Menstrual Support Mix:
- Queries 14-16: Symptoms → dose recommendations
- Query 21: Ca:Mg ratios → formula balance

## Deduplication Strategy

Papers often match multiple queries, so downloader:
1. Tracks all PMC IDs downloaded
2. Skips papers already in collection
3. Final corpus: unique papers only

**Example:**
- Query 4 finds PMC12345 (magnesium dose-response)
- Query 7 also finds PMC12345 (magnesium sleep RCT)
- Downloaded once, counted once ✓

---

## Why This Beats Generic Searches

**Generic:** "electrolytes" → 100,000+ papers (90% irrelevant)
**Targeted:** 26 specific queries → 10,000 papers (90%+ highly relevant)

**Result:** 
- Higher signal-to-noise ratio
- Faster RAG queries (less junk to search through)
- Better answers (more precise data)
