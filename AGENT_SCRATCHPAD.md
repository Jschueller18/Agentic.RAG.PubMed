**Impact:** System now optimized for extracting quantitative research data needed to calculate optimal sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium amounts per serving based on survey variables.

**Next Priority:** Download full set of electrolyte research papers from PMC and build vector store.

### **Session 3 Progress (October 3, 2025)**

**PMC API Test Results:**
```
✓ All tests passed successfully!
- Found 15 papers across 3 test queries
- 0 duplicates (100% unique)
- Average file size: ~2,143 bytes per paper
- API response time: Fast (< 5 seconds)
```

**Test Queries that worked:**
- 'magnesium absorption bioavailability': 5 papers
- 'sodium supplementation metabolism': 5 papers  
- 'potassium citrate bioavailability': 5 papers

**Status:** PMC API verified working. Ready to download full dataset (~100-120 papers).

### **Architecture Decision: Live API + Auto-Caching (Oct 3, 2025)**

**Problem:** Generic pre-downloaded papers (e.g., "calcium citrate vs carbonate") not optimal for BestMove's hyper-specific technical queries.

**Solution:** Live API retrieval with automatic corpus building

**Architecture:**
```
Query → PubMed API (live) → Fetch 20 candidates → Re-rank (cross-encoder) 
  → Top 5 results → Auto-save to electrolyte_research_papers/ → Return
```

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Access to millions of papers (not just 100 pre-downloaded)
- ✅ Queries like "magnesium dose-response sleep latency age groups" find exact studies needed
- ✅ Papers automatically cached for future customer chatbot corpus
- ✅ Organic corpus building: only papers actually used in formulation research
- ✅ RAG architecture preserved: Still uses cross-encoder re-ranking (Cell 47 logic)
- ✅ Latency: 15-30 seconds (acceptable for R&D, not customer-facing)

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create `live_research_tool` as separate tool (test independently)
2. Keep existing `librarian_rag_tool` untouched initially
3. Add paper cache manager (`papers_cache.json`, `query_history.json`)
4. Test with BestMove technical queries
5. Once validated, optionally replace Cell 47 implementation

**File Structure After Implementation:**
```
electrolyte_research_papers/     # Auto-growing corpus
├── PMC_12345.txt               # Each paper saved on first fetch
├── PMC_67890.txt
└── ...
papers_cache.json                # Metadata: all cached papers
query_history.json               # Which queries found which papers
```

**Status:** ✅ Live research tool fully tested and validated! Ready for notebook integration.

**Test Results:**
```
✓ sentence-transformers installed (PyTorch 2.8.0, 887.9 MB)
✓ Test query 1: Found 1 paper, cached successfully
✓ Test query 2: Found 20 papers, cached 19, re-ranked, returned top 5
✓ Auto-caching working: papers saved to electrolyte_research_papers/
✓ Metadata tracking: papers_cache.json and query_history.json created
✓ Cross-encoder re-ranking operational (scores: 6.12 to 3.80 for top results)
✓ Papers highly relevant (e.g., "Chronic Organic Magnesium Supplementation")
```

**Files Created:**
- `live_research_tool.py` - Standalone live API tool with auto-caching ✅
- `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete integration instructions for notebook ✅
- `electrolyte_research_papers/` - 20 cached papers with full abstracts ✅
- `papers_cache.json` - Metadata tracking (6 papers in top results) ✅
- `query_history.json` - Query logging ✅

**Next Steps:**
1. ⏳ Follow INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md to add live_api_research_tool to notebook
2. ⏳ Test with BestMove technical queries through full agent system
3. ⏳ Validate Supervisor chooses appropriate tool for query types

## 🎯 BestMove Use Cases & Example R&D Queries

### **Sleep Support Mix**
Technical queries for algorithm development:
1. "What is the exact dose-response relationship for magnesium on sleep onset latency across different age groups (18-30, 31-50, 51-65, 65+), controlling for baseline magnesium status?"
2. "How does body composition (lean mass vs. fat mass) affect magnesium distribution volume and optimal dosing for sleep, beyond simple weight-based scaling?"
3. "What genetic polymorphisms (TRPM6, TRPM7, CNNM2) affect magnesium absorption efficiency, and what are their prevalence rates across populations?"

### **Workout Performance Mix**
Technical queries for algorithm development:
1. "In controlled studies measuring whole-body sweat losses, what is the actual multiplicative interaction coefficient between exercise intensity (measured as %VO2max) and duration for sodium losses? Specifically, does a 2-hour run at 75% VO2max produce 2.0x the sodium loss of a 1-hour run, or does the coefficient deviate from linearity (e.g., 1.8x or 2.3x)?"
2. "Across longitudinal studies tracking the same individuals during heat acclimatization protocols, what are the specific time constants (τ in days) for: (a) sweat rate increases, (b) sweat sodium concentration decreases, and (c) plasma volume expansion? How do these three adaptations interact to affect total sodium loss recommendations over a 14-day acclimatization period?"
3. "In studies where the same athletes undergo repeated sweat testing under identical conditions, what is the within-individual coefficient of variation for sweat sodium concentration? And how does this compare to between-individual variation? At what sample size (n sessions) does the standard error of an individual's mean stabilize to within ±10% of their true value?"

### **Daily Wellness Mix**
Technical queries for algorithm development:
1. "What does recent research (last 5 years) say about age-specific variations in electrolyte absorption efficiency and requirements for adults aged 30-65 in non-exercise contexts? Specifically, should our Daily Support Mix algorithm apply different scaling factors beyond the current kidney function adjustment (0.98^(age-30)) to account for gut absorption changes, hormonal shifts, or metabolic differences across decades?"
2. "What evidence exists for how different dietary patterns (Mediterranean, ketogenic, plant-based, intermittent fasting, Standard American Diet) affect baseline electrolyte status and supplementation needs in sedentary to lightly active adults? Are our current diet-type multipliers (plant-based: 0.8x, keto: 1.2x sodium) adequately capturing the electrolyte demands and deficiencies associated with each pattern, or should we be applying more nuanced adjustments by individual mineral?"
3. "Beyond the baseline DRI differences and the 1.15x fluid multiplier for males, what does current research indicate about gender-specific electrolyte metabolism, utilization, and requirements for non-pregnant, non-menstruating adults in daily life contexts? Should our Daily Support Mix algorithm incorporate additional gender-based adjustments for factors like muscle mass differences, hormonal influences on mineral retention, or sex-specific chronic disease risk profiles?"

### **Menstrual Support Mix**
Technical queries for algorithm development:
1. "What are the exact dose-response curves for magnesium supplementation and menstrual cramp severity across different age groups (18-25, 26-35, 36-45)? Retrieve RCTs measuring pain scores (VAS/NRS) at different magnesium doses (100mg, 200mg, 300mg, 400mg) and calculate the marginal benefit per 50mg increment."
2. "For women on combination oral contraceptives, analyze studies measuring serum magnesium and zinc levels at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24+ of continuous use. What is the mathematical relationship between duration and depletion rate? Does depletion plateau or continue linearly?"
3. "In studies where both calcium and magnesium were supplemented for menstrual symptoms, what Ca:Mg ratios (1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1) showed optimal efficacy? Are there interaction effects where the ratio matters more than absolute doses?"

- Total papers: 100-120 (6 queries × 20 papers)
- After deduplication: ~80-100 unique papers
- Vector DB size: ~200-300 chunks (after chunking abstracts)
- Structured DB: 10 electrolyte forms

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **PMC API is robust**: No authentication needed, generous rate limits
2. **Text format simpler than PDF**: Abstracts are well-structured, easier to parse
3. **Virtual env essential**: PEP 668 protection on modern Ubuntu requires venv
4. **Architecture is domain-agnostic**: Most of the RAG pipeline needs no logic changes
5. **Prompt updates are the main work**: Converting financial → research terminology

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Notes

1. **Virtual Environment**: Must activate before running any Python scripts
2. **pip not installed by default**: Required `apt install python3-pip` and `python3-venv`
3. **Sample paper content**: Test retrieval included some non-electrolyte papers (like ritonavir) - may need more specific queries for production
4. **Metadata quality**: Depends on abstract availability in PMC (most have full abstracts)

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Full-text PDF retrieval**: Some PMC papers have full PDFs available
2. **Citation network analysis**: PMC provides citation links
3. **Temporal analysis**: Track research trends over time
4. **Multi-modal vision**: Extract data from charts/tables in papers (Phase 6 feature)
5. **Semantic Scholar integration**: Additional paper source for broader coverage
