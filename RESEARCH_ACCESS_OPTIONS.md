## Recommended Strategy for BestMove

### Phase 1: Literature Review (Month 1)
**Tool: DeepDyve ($40-50)**
- Search and read unlimited papers
- Identify the 50-100 most critical papers with actual data you need
- Export citations and abstracts
- Take notes on which have the quantitative data you need

### Phase 2: Targeted Acquisition (Month 2-3)
**Multiple approaches:**
1. **ResearchGate requests** - Contact authors directly for the identified papers
2. **Alumni access** - If available, download PDFs of key papers
3. **Public library access** - Check what databases they provide
4. **Direct author contact** - Surprisingly effective! Researchers often happy to share

### Phase 3: Build Permanent Database
Once you have the PDFs, our automated system:
1. Parses PDFs with `unstructured` library
2. Extracts tables, methods, results
3. Converts to markdown
4. Stores in searchable database
5. You own this corpus forever!

## Legal Alternatives to Avoid
- Sci-Hub (legal issues)
- LibGen (copyright concerns)
- Any piracy sites

Better to spend $100-200 on legitimate access and build a proper database once than risk legal issues.
