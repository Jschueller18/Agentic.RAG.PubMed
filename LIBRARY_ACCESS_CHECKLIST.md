# Library Database Access - Quick Check (Do This NOW!)

## Step 1: Ask the Librarian (5 minutes)

Go to the reference desk and ask:

> "Hi! I'm doing health research and need access to biomedical databases. 
> Does the library provide access to any of these:
> - PubMed/MEDLINE
> - EBSCO Health databases  
> - ProQuest Health & Medical
> - CINAHL
> - Any medical/health science databases?"

**They will tell you:**
- What databases you have access to
- How to log in (usually through library website with your card number)
- Whether you can download PDFs
- If there are download limits

## Step 2: Test Access (10 minutes)

### On Library Computer or WiFi:

1. **Go to your library's website**
2. **Look for:** "Databases" or "Research Resources" or "Online Resources"
3. **Log in** with your library card number
4. **Search for:** "Health Sciences" or "Medical" databases

### Common Databases Libraries Provide:

**EBSCO Health Collection**
- Often includes full-text access
- Good for biomedical research
- Can usually download PDFs

**ProQuest Health & Medical**
- Full-text journal access
- Download capability

**Gale Health & Wellness**
- Consumer-focused but has research articles

## Step 3: Test a Sample Paper

**Try searching for this paper:**
- Title: "Magnesium supplementation and sleep"
- Try finding any magnesium + sleep paper

**Check:**
- ✅ Can you see the full text?
- ✅ Can you download a PDF?
- ✅ Is there a download limit (per day/month)?

## Step 4: Automation Potential

### If Library Access Works:

**Manual Process (No automation):**
1. Use PubMed to identify papers
2. Note the PMID or DOI
3. Look up each paper in library database
4. Download PDF manually
5. ~5-10 minutes per paper

**Semi-Automated:**
1. Export list of PMIDs from PubMed
2. Check which have full-text in library system
3. Batch download where possible
4. Manual download for others

**Reality Check:**
Most library systems don't allow full automation due to:
- Terms of service restrictions
- CAPTCHA protection
- Session management

**Estimate:** 50 papers = 4-8 hours of manual downloading
