# Vector Store Builder Guide

## Overview
This script takes your 203,174 processed chunks and creates a searchable vector database ready for RAG queries.

**What it does:**
1. Loads all chunks from `processed_corpus/chunks/`
2. Generates embeddings using `fastembed` (local, fast, free!)
3. Stores in Qdrant vector database with rich metadata
4. Creates optimized indexes for semantic search

**Estimated time:** 30-60 minutes  
**Cost:** $0 (runs locally!)

## Quick Start

### Run the Builder

```bash
cd /home/jschu/projects/Agentic.RAG
python3 build_vector_store.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Load 203,174 chunks
- ✅ Generate embeddings (384-dim vectors)
- ✅ Store in Qdrant with metadata
- ✅ Verify with test search
- ✅ Show statistics

## Test Search (After Building)

You can test the vector store with quick searches:

```bash
python3 build_vector_store.py search "magnesium sleep"
python3 build_vector_store.py search "calcium bioavailability citrate vs carbonate"
python3 build_vector_store.py search "potassium dose response exercise performance"
```

---

## What Gets Stored

### Metadata for Each Chunk:
- `text` - Full chunk text
- `pmcid` - PubMed Central ID
- `title` - Paper title
- `authors` - First 5 authors
- `journal` - Journal name
- `year` - Publication year
- `chunk_id` - Chunk number (0-indexed)
- `total_chunks` - Total chunks in paper
- `has_methods` - Boolean (has Methods section)
- `has_results` - Boolean (has Results section)
- `num_tables` - Number of tables in paper

### This metadata enables:
✅ **Filtering by year:** Only papers from 2020-2025  
✅ **Filtering by content:** Only chunks from papers with Methods sections  
✅ **Source attribution:** Show which paper a result came from  
✅ **Relevance scoring:** Prioritize papers with tables (quantitative data)

## Technical Details

### Embedding Model: BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5
- **Dimensions:** 384 (compact, fast)
- **Performance:** Top-tier on MTEB benchmark
- **Speed:** ~1,000 chunks/second
- **Size:** ~130 MB model download
- **Cost:** FREE (runs locally)

### Vector Database: Qdrant
- **Storage:** ~500 MB for 203K vectors
- **Speed:** Sub-millisecond search
- **Scalable:** Can handle millions of vectors
- **Local:** No cloud dependencies

### Memory Requirements
- **Peak RAM:** ~4 GB
- **Disk space:** ~600 MB total
- **GPU:** Not required (CPU-only)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Out of memory" error
Reduce batch size in `build_vector_store.py`:
```python
BATCH_SIZE = 50  # Instead of 100
```

### "Collection already exists"
The script automatically deletes old collections. If you want to keep the old one:
```python
# Comment out this line in create_vector_collection()
# client.delete_collection(collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME)
```

### Slow embedding generation
This is normal - 203K chunks take 30-60 minutes. You can:
- Run in background: `nohup python3 build_vector_store.py &`
- Monitor progress: `tail -f nohup.out`

---

## Next Step: Integrate with Notebook

Once the vector store is built, you'll update `code.ipynb` to use it:

### Change 1: Vector DB Path
```python
# OLD (SEC filings):
client = QdrantClient(path="./financial_rag_db")

# NEW (BestMove):
client = QdrantClient(path="./bestmove_vector_db")
```

### Change 2: Collection Name
```python
# OLD:
collection_name = "sec_filings"

# NEW:
collection_name = "bestmove_research"
```

### Change 3: Update Prompts
Change all prompts from financial analyst → electrolyte research analyst.

That's it! The RAG pipeline is already built - just point it to your new data.

## Example Queries to Test

Once integrated with the notebook, try these BestMove-specific queries:

**Bioavailability:**
- "What is the bioavailability of magnesium glycinate compared to magnesium oxide?"
- "Which form of calcium is best absorbed: citrate or carbonate?"

**Dose-Response:**
- "What is the optimal magnesium dose for improving sleep quality?"
- "What dosage of potassium is recommended for athletes during exercise?"

**Use Cases:**
- "How does magnesium supplementation affect sleep latency and quality?"
- "What minerals help reduce menstrual cramps and PMS symptoms?"

**Population Differences:**
- "Do elderly people require different electrolyte dosages than younger adults?"
- "How does gender affect magnesium requirements?"

**Interactions:**
- "What minerals should not be taken together?"
- "Does calcium interfere with magnesium absorption?"
