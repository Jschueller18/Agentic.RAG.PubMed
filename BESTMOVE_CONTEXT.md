# BestMove - Personalized Electrolyte Supplementation

## Company Overview

**BestMove** creates personalized electrolyte supplements tailored to individual body, lifestyle, and goals. Instead of generic one-size-fits-all products, we use a comprehensive health survey to calculate exact mineral needs based on diet, exercise habits, sleep patterns, and health conditions.

## Product Line - Four Use Cases

### 1. **Daily Wellness Mix**
Baseline electrolyte support for daily life, optimized for individual metabolism, diet type, age, and lifestyle factors.

### 2. **Workout Performance Mix**  
Exercise-specific formulation accounting for sweat losses, exercise intensity, duration, heat acclimatization status, and individual sweat composition.

### 3. **Sleep Quality Mix**
Mineral ratios optimized for sleep onset, sleep depth, and muscle relaxation, with focus on magnesium forms and timing.

### 4. **Menstrual Support Mix**
Hormone-aware formulation addressing cramping, PMS symptoms, and mineral depletion during menstrual cycle, accounting for contraceptive use.

## Core Value Proposition

**Problem Solved:** Most people either:
- Take too little to see benefits
- Take too much, risking side effects
- Use wrong forms with poor absorption

**Solution:** Science-backed algorithm determines optimal amounts of:
- Sodium
- Potassium  
- Magnesium
- Calcium

Customized for:
- Body composition
- Exercise patterns
- Diet type
- Sleep quality
- Menstrual cycle
- Age & sex
- Health conditions
- Environmental factors (heat, altitude)

## RAG System Purpose

### Configuration 1: Internal R&D
**Users:** Research team developing/refining formulation algorithms

**Query Types:**
- Dose-response relationships across populations
- Interaction coefficients (e.g., exercise intensity Ã— duration for sodium loss)
- Time constants for adaptation (e.g., heat acclimatization)
- Genetic polymorphisms affecting absorption
- Population-specific requirements (age, sex, diet, etc.)
- Within-individual vs between-individual variability
- Optimal mineral ratios for specific outcomes

**Output Style:** Technical, quantitative, focused on extracting specific coefficients and relationships for algorithm parameters

### Configuration 2: Customer Chatbot
**Users:** Customers wanting to understand their personalized formula

**Query Types:**
- Why their formula contains certain amounts
- How to use specific mixes
- General electrolyte education
- What electrolytes are good for
- Whether to use multiple mixes
- Source-backed explanations

**Output Style:** Accessible, credible, always citing sources, avoiding medical claims while being informative

## Key Minerals & Forms

**Sodium:**
- Chloride (95% bioavailability)
- Citrate (98% bioavailability)

**Potassium:**
- Chloride (90% bioavailability)
- Citrate (94% bioavailability)

**Magnesium:**
- Oxide (4% bioavailability, high elemental %)
- Citrate (30% bioavailability)
- Glycinate (42% bioavailability, gentle on stomach)

**Calcium:**
- Carbonate (40% bioavailability, high elemental %)
- Citrate (35% bioavailability, better absorption)
- Lactate (38% bioavailability)

## Research Focus Areas

1. **Individual Variability**
   - Age-specific absorption differences
   - Sex-based metabolic differences
   - Genetic factors (TRPM6, TRPM7, CNNM2)
   - Body composition effects

2. **Lifestyle Factors**
   - Exercise intensity/duration interactions
   - Heat acclimatization kinetics
   - Sweat loss individual variability
   - Diet type effects on baseline status

3. **Use Case Optimization**
   - Sleep: Magnesium dose-response for sleep latency
   - Workout: Sodium loss prediction models
   - Daily: Age-adjusted baseline requirements
   - Menstrual: Hormone-mineral interactions, contraceptive effects

4. **Absorption & Interactions**
   - Ca:Mg ratios for different outcomes
   - Form comparisons for specific use cases
   - Timing optimization (with meals, bedtime, etc.)
   - Competitive absorption effects
