    "# Agentic RAG: Electrolyte Research Intelligence System\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Electrolyte Research RAG Pipeline**. This notebook implements an advanced agentic RAG system that goes beyond simple search to truly understand and reason about electrolyte research literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "This system is adapted from a sophisticated financial analysis agent, now repurposed for electrolyte and nutrition science research. Instead of analyzing SEC filings, we'll be working with peer-reviewed biomedical literature from PubMed Central.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key capabilities:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The Scribe (Long-Term Memory):** Persistent **Cognitive Memory** store to remember key insights and research findings across conversations.\n",
    "2.  **The Watchtower (Proactive Monitoring):** A **Monitoring Engine** that scans for new electrolyte research publications and proactively alerts users.\n",
    "3.  **The Oracle (Multi-Modal Vision):** A **Vision Analyst Tool** to interpret charts, graphs, and experimental results from research papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers the entire lifecycle:\n",
    "- **Phase 0:** Setup and Data Acquisition (PubMed Central)\n",
    "- **Phase 1:** Building the Knowledge Core (Research Papers)\n",
    "- **Phase 2:** Upgrading the Specialist Agent Workforce\n",
    "- **Phase 3:** Orchestrating the Reasoning Engine\n",
    "- **Phase 4:** Advanced Evaluation of Precision and Depth\n",
